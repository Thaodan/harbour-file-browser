about most common questions.

responsibility if that happens. So, be careful.

### Acknowledgements

Exif data embedded in image files is displayed with [JHead](http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/),
which is a public domain Exif manipulation tool.

### Other file managers

There is a very handy two-paned file manager called Cargo Dock
in the Jolla Store. Give it a try if you are moving a lot of files.

There are a number of other file managers available in OpenRepos.
